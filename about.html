      My name is Joshua and I am a geek, in the sense of the term as it is used today (no biting off heads of chickens here!!).  I like to consider myself a perpetual student of things that interest me. I like computers, electronics, robotics, cars, and a myriad of other things too numerous to list. I like when I come across a problem and then try to figure out how to solve that issue. I like sitting around with people that are good at what they do...and try to figure how to make it better using technology. Sometimes it needs technology to be built, sometimes its hardware that needs to be made, sometimes its just figuring out how to use off the shelf things to make it happen...this type of thing really excites me!

      Ok so I do have a quirk...like most people. I talk to myself. When I am in the zone working on things...tuned into whatever it is...I talk out loud to work toward the solution. When things don't make sense or didn't go as planned...I talk to myself...like I am going to answer myself...sometimes I do!

      My personal life. I am happily married to a wonderful woman I do not deserve. I have a wonderful family with her and I am blessed by this.

      My professional journey is a wonderfully complex tale best left for coffee and conversation. It can be summed up this way. I have learned a lot of things in the course of trying everything. I have learned what I do not like, I have learned what I like. I have found some of my limitations, and I still have more to explore. I look forward to learning more.
